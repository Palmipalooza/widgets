First React Hooks Project

Use of React Hooks to build reusable components. Includes example of managing state in Accordion Component with class based component for reference.

Accordion Component - shows only one item at a time. When one item is clicked, the details about it are expanded while the details about the previously open item is collapsed. Accordion component keeps track of this piece of state with react hooks.
