First React Hooks Project

Use of React Hooks to build reusable components. Includes example of managing state in Accordion Component with class based component for reference.

Accordion Component - shows only one item at a time. When one item is clicked, the details about it are expanded while the details about the previously open item is collapsed. Accordion component keeps track of this piece of state.
