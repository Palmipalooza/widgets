Four separate widgets in one application

Use of React Hooks to build reusable components.

Accordion Widget - shows only one item at a time. When one item is clicked, the details about it are expanded while the details about the previously open item is collapsed. Accordion component keeps track of this piece of state with react hooks. Accordion component can be reused for a large list of information.

Hooks Used: useState
